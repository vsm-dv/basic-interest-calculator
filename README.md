This basic calculator finds the value of any variable of the simple interest formula and the compound interest formula. You only need to inform the correct values for each component of the equation after you select the variable you wish to solve for. <br>
You can access it <a href="https://vsm-dv.github.io/basic-interest-calculator/">here</a>. <br> <br>
The calculator is based on the following formulas and their derived equations:

**Simple interest formula:**
Interest = P * r * (t/100)


**Compound interest formula:**
Future Amount = P * (1 + r/100)^t

where:
- P = principal
- r = rate per period
- t = number of periods

**If the rate is annual but the number of periods is in months, you need to convert it into years:**<br>
For example: 6 months = 0.5 years.

**Or if you have the value of a monthly rate and the time is in years, you can convert it into months:**<br>
For example: 1.5 years = 18 months.

**When you calculate the compound interest, you need to pay attention to the number of periods and the rate per period:**<br>
For example: if the nominal rate is compounded semianually, you need to divide it by 2 (there are 2 periods of 6 months in a year), in order to find the rate per period. <br>
Also, if it is compounded for 5 years, the number of periods is 10 (5 years * 2 periods of 6 months).
